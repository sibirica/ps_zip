function [x0,y0,iout,jout] = intersections(x1,y1,x2,y2,robust) 
%INTERSECTIONS Intersections of curves. 
% Computes the (x,y) locations where two curves intersect. The curves 
% can be broken with NaNs or have vertical segments. 
% 
% Example: 
% [X0,Y0] = intersections(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,ROBUST); 
% 
% where X1 and Y1 are equal-length vectors of at least two points and 
% represent curve 1. Similarly, X2 and Y2 represent curve 2. 
% X0 and Y0 are column vectors containing the points at which the two 
% curves intersect. 
% 
% ROBUST (optional) set to 1 or true means to use a slight variation of the 
% algorithm that might return duplicates of some intersection points, and 
% then remove those duplicates. The default is true, but since the 
% algorithm is slightly slower you can set it to false if you know that 
% your curves don't intersect at any segment boundaries. Also, the robust 
% version properly handles parallel and overlapping segments. 
% 
% The algorithm can return two additional vectors that indicate which 
% segment pairs contain intersections and where they are: 
% 
% [X0,Y0,I,J] = intersections(X1,Y1,X2,Y2,ROBUST); 
% 
% For each element of the vector I, I(k) = (segment number of (X1,Y1)) + 
% (how far along this segment the intersection is). For example, if I(k) = 
% 45.25 then the intersection lies a quarter of the way between the line 
% segment connecting (X1(45),Y1(45)) and (X1(46),Y1(46)). Similarly for 
% the vector J and the segments in (X2,Y2). 
% 
% You can also get intersections of a curve with itself. Simply pass in 
% only one curve, i.e., 
% 
% [X0,Y0] = intersections(X1,Y1,ROBUST); 
% 
% where, as before, ROBUST is optional.

% Theory of operation: 
% 
% Given two line segments, L1 and L2, 
% 
% L1 endpoints: (x1(1),y1(1)) and (x1(2),y1(2)) 
% L2 endpoints: (x2(1),y2(1)) and (x2(2),y2(2)) 
% 
% we can write four equations with four unknowns and then solve them. The 
% four unknowns are t1, t2, x0 and y0, where (x0,y0) is the intersection of 
% L1 and L2, t1 is the distance from the starting point of L1 to the 
% intersection relative to the length of L1 and t2 is the distance from the 
% starting point of L2 to the intersection relative to the length of L2. 
% 
% So, the four equations are 
% 
% (x1(2) - x1(1))*t1 = x0 - x1(1) 
% (x2(2) - x2(1))*t2 = x0 - x2(1) 
% (y1(2) - y1(1))*t1 = y0 - y1(1) 
% (y2(2) - y2(1))*t2 = y0 - y2(1) 
% 
% Rearranging and writing in matrix form, 
% 
% [x1(2)-x1(1) 0 -1 0; [t1; [-x1(1); 
% 0 x2(2)-x2(1) -1 0; * t2; = -x2(1); 
% y1(2)-y1(1) 0 0 -1; x0; -y1(1); 
% 0 y2(2)-y2(1) 0 -1] y0] -y2(1)] 
% 
% Let's call that A*T = B. We can solve for T with T = A\B. 
% 
% Once we have our solution we just have to look at t1 and t2 to determine 
% whether L1 and L2 intersect. If 0 <= t1 < 1 and 0 <= t2 < 1 then the two 
% line segments cross and we can include (x0,y0) in the output. 
% 
% In principle, we have to perform this computation on every pair of line 
% segments in the input data. This can be quite a large number of pairs so 
% we will reduce it by doing a simple preliminary check to eliminate line 
% segment pairs that could not possibly cross. The check is to look at the 
% smallest enclosing rectangles (with sides parallel to the axes) for each 
% line segment pair and see if they overlap. If they do then we have to 
% compute t1 and t2 (via the A\B computation) to see if the line segments 
% cross, but if they don't then the line segments cannot cross. In a 
% typical application, this technique will eliminate most of the potential 
% line segment pairs.
